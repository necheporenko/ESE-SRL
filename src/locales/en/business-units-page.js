    In Bolivia, according to the Electricity Authority, about 70% of power
    generation comes from thermos plants. And of this figure at least 30% has
    installed ESE. In 2012, the company participated, for example as a
    subcontractor, in the engineering, supply, construction and assembly works
    of the El Kenko II (El Alto) thermoelectric power plant, which injects 17.5
    megawatts (MW) National Interconnected (SIN). Subsequently, ESE was also
    awarded the engineering, construction and electromechanical assemblies of
    Termoeléctrica del Sur (Tarija) in which four turbogenerators of the German
    Siemens SGT-800 industry were installed. We have also been awarded the
    execution of the civil works and the electromechanical assembly of the
    Warnes Thermoelectric plant with the installation of five Siemens
    turbogenerators.

  <p>
    ESE has demonstrated that it has all the technical and operative capacity to
    work as an EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) firm, which
    means, to take care of the design, provision of supplies and the
    construction of any electromechanical project. We have 498 MW of installed
    capacity in Bolivia and 742 MW of power in the process of installation.

    The company also carried out the electromechanical, pre-commissioning,
    commissioning and commissioning of the Río Tercero thermoelectric plant,
    located in Córdoba (Argentina), together with the company Carlos Caballero,
    generating a favorable acceptance from the client: SoEnergy Argentina.

    It is necessary to build well-planned distribution networks in order to link
    the electricity generating centers to the points of consumption. And to
    design, build and maintain this energy efficiently requires at least three
    requirements: have trained personnel, appropriate clothing and specialized
    equipment.

    ESE made the electromechanical assembly and civil works between Cochabamba
    and La Paz on the 4,500 meters above sea level that included the
    construction of entry, exit and expansion bays. Several transmission lines
    were also carried out between the boundaries of La Paz and Beni with results
    that were highly accepted by customers. ESE has the personnel trained to
    make the foundations for transformers, fire walls, porticos, patio
