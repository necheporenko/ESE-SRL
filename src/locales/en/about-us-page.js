    The history of the Electromechanical Services Company ESE SRL began
    to come out ahead in the late 1980s. The world was shocking about
    the fall of the Berlin Wall, a lot of people were also debating the
    dissolution of the Soviet Union and other ones were marveling at
    Maradona's skill on the court. In Bolivia, the democracy was
    starting to take its first steps and the economy was afloat
    following an intentional process known as hyperinflation. The
    population in the country did not work with the internet or less
    with cell phones.
  </p>
  <p>
    That same year the INE reported that Santa Cruz had an estimated
    population of 800,000. Hundreds of families migrated to this region
    attracted by investments and projects that were developed mainly in
    agriculture, industry and commerce. And as the population grew, so
    did the demand for water, energy, health and education.

      At the end of 1989, Arturo Vera Velasco, a young man who learned how
      to install coils from his 15 years and who knew how to face each
      problem with self-effacement, was the founder of Electromechanical
      Services Company ESE SRL. The principles with which company started
      were inherent to what he was: to work with honesty, responsibility and
      above all with professionalism to satisfy his clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company began to provide services with two workers, a van and a
      small office located at the end of Paraguá Avenue, in the north of
      Santa Cruz. The confidence of the companies we were winning step by
      step. Institutions like CRE, YPFB, among others, supported the work of
      ESE. Step by step, more workers joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1994, as the company grew and maintained a balance between its
      accounts and the workforce, the executives of this firm acquired land
      in the area with the largest concentration of private companies in
      Santa Cruz: the Industrial Park. Months later, they built the office
      where the company currently operates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-seven years have passed since that day. Vera, along with her
      two sons, Marco, Diego and the professional contribution of each of
      his workers, has developed more than a hundred projects of economic
      and social relevance. Nowadays is one of the few companies in the
      country that offer EPC -Engineering, Procurement & Construction-
      services or also known as turnkey signatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these years, ESE together with CRE contributed to the expansion
      of public lighting in Santa Cruz. It also became one of the pioneer
      companies in incorporating specialized equipment for the service of
      maintenance of live lines in low and medium voltage and developed
      experience in the construction of electrical grids in the east, west,
      valley and the mountain range.
    </p>
    <p>
      ESE, with the incorporation of new technologies, the company entered
      into the Electrical Maintenance Services to the Oil Companies (SEEP)
      and in the Industrial Services of Electromechanical Assembly (SEM). As
      a subcontractor, the company participated and is involved in the
      design, construction and assembly of large thermoelectric plants in
      the country, such as El Kenko 2 (El Alto), Del Sur (Tarija), Warnes
      (Santa Cruz) and Entre Ríos (Cochabamba) . We have also built a dozen
      power substations located in strategic locations in Tarija,
      Chuquisaca, La Paz, Beni and Cochabamba.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company has the certificate of the integrated management system
      audited by Tüv Rheinland Quality: ISO 9001, Occupational Safety and
      Health: OHSAS 18001; and Environment: ISO 14001. Actually, ESE keeps
      alive its principles with which it began: to be a company that leads
      the electromechanical services sector, meeting the management, health,
      safety and environmental standards. It generates more than 600 direct
      jobs and has received various awards for being a contractor company
      with great technical attributes.
